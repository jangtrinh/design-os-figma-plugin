// Registry-integrity phase 01 (5.1) — file↔project binding. Durable project state (the
// registry, its sidecars, cursor, manifest) currently derives from the broker's OWN spawn
// cwd (figma-sync-config.ts's `projectDir()`), never from which project the edit actually
// came from. This module is the fix's pure core: it never guesses a project for an unknown
// file — the caller (figma-sync-apply.ts §3) must refuse instead.
//
// Persistence has two stores, each with one job (see phase-01-project-binding.md §2):
//   - `<projectDir>/design/figma-bind.json` — the DURABLE TRUTH. Reviewable in git, moves
//     with the repo, survives everything.
//   - `/tmp/figma-agent-binds.json` (bindCacheFile) — the broker's RESTART-SURVIVAL CACHE:
//     just enough (a list of project dirs) to know where to re-scan for markers at startup.
//     Without it the broker has no directory to look in after a restart, so an explicit
//     bind would silently stop working until the next CLI request re-teaches it.

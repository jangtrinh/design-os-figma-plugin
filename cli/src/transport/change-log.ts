 * Crash-safety (fix round, closing defect #1 — "loss is worse than a duplicate, so the
 * marker follows the append"): a bare copy-then-delete leaves a window where a crash
 * between the append (b) and the cleanup (d/e) makes the NEXT migrate re-append the same
 * frames. The marker-file protocol closes it: (a) hash the staged content, (b) append,
 * (c) write `<staging>.migrated.json {hash, at}`, (d) unlink staging, (e) unlink marker.
 * On retry:
 *   - staging exists + a marker with a MATCHING hash → the append already landed (crashed
 *     somewhere in c/d/e) — just finish cleanup, report 0 (nothing NEW was migrated).
 *   - staging exists + marker missing/mismatched → belt check the bound log's own tail
 *     against the staged content (cheap — see `boundLogEndsWith`): a match means the
 *     append landed but the marker write (c) never did (crashed in the b→c window) —
 *     write the marker now, then finish cleanup, report 0. No match → genuinely fresh:
 *     append, write marker, clean up, report the real count.
 *
 * Still fully synchronous end to end, so a DOC_CHANGE arriving in a LATER event-loop tick
 * can never interleave mid-copy — Node's single-threaded event loop never runs another
 * 'message' handler between these statements, and by the time migration runs the identity
 * is already recorded as bound, so any subsequent batch goes straight to the bound path.

//   free / starter seat → ease-design's own figma-agent CLI (Plugin API,
//                          editor rights on Figma Free, native variable binding)
//   paid full / dev seat → the official Figma MCP (use_figma, richer reads)
//   DesignAgent is NOT adopted — the figma-agent CLI supersedes it.
